##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> I had some minor problems with spacing and similar issues, but they were resolved by putting every div in a container/row/col structure. It could be clearer that most things should be layed out in this fashion, I don't think the assignment mentioned rows at all. Maybe it was just me.
